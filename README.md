# Audiobooks Project

This project involves gathering and processing data for a Data Analyst at an Audiobook company. The starting data comes from the company's database (MySQL), collected from the company website. We will also use this data to make a dashboard that shows the best-selling products. This will help in choosing which products to promote and planning promotions to boost audiobook sales.
